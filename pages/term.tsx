                <h3>GREG NFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT & LICENSING TERMS</h3>
                <p>As used in these terms, “GREG” means a non-fungible, unique token (“ONFT/NFT”) on the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains that, as of its genesis issuance, contains a link to a unique image (“Art”). Each owner of an GREG (“Owner”) has the non-exclusive right to use, copy and display the Art linked to his/her GREG to the extent that such use, copy, or display results from the operation of the smart contract related to the GREG and only  for so long as the Owner owns the GREG (as recorded on the relevant blockchain), in each case, solely for his/her own personal, non-commercial use (e.g., home display, display in a virtual gallery), including to create a reasonable number of back-up copies and a physical print out. This right is personal and cannot be transferred (other than in connection with a sale or transfer of the GREG) or sub-licensed. For the avoidance of doubt, this right does not include any right or license to use, copy, display or otherwise exploit the Art for any non-personal or commercial purposes, or to create any derivative works of the Art.</p>

                <h3>GREG LICENSE AGREEMENT</h3>
                <p>This GREG License Agreement (this “Agreement”) is a legally binding agreement by and between Omniverse Labs, Inc. (“Omniverse Labs” or “us”), a Delaware corporation, and any owner of any GREG (defined below) (“you” or “Purchaser”). Omniverse Labs and each Purchaser may be referred to throughout this Agreement collectively as the “Parties” or individually as a “Party”. This Agreement governs the rights and obligations with respect to a GREG. By purchasing or otherwise owning a GREG, you acknowledge that you have carefully read and agree to the terms of this Agreement.</p>

                <h3>Artistic Purposes Only.</h3>
                <p>Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser (A) is purchasing the Greg for personal enjoyment purposes, and (B) is not purchasing any Greg with the intent or expectation of profits from any appreciation in value or otherwise from the Greg or any Access Rights that may from time to time be granted by Omni X or third parties.

                IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND Omniverse Labs THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 16 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 16 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 15 (GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM CHOICE) OR RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW WILL STILL APPLY.</p>

                <h3>1. GREG Defined.</h3>
                <p>“GREG” refers to a non-fungible, unique token on the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains (“ONFT/NFT”) (i.e., a controllable electronic record on a blockchain) and that, as of its genesis issuance, contains an image of Art. “Art” means each of the unique images of the 4,500 “GREGs” each associated with, and linked to, an individual GREG ONFT/NFT.</p>

                <h3>2. Additional Terms.</h3>
                <p>GREGs may be available for purchase or transfer (i) on one or more third-party platforms, such as OpenSea, or other marketplaces that may be established from time to time (each, an “ONFT/NFT Marketplace”), which we do not operate, or (ii) directly from third-party owners of GREGs (such transactions, “Direct Sales”). The access and use of any ONFT/NFT Marketplace is subject to the separate terms of that ONFT/NFT Marketplace and any Direct Sales are subject to the terms thereof. In addition, although we do not guarantee that they will, third parties may grant GREG owners various entitlements and benefits. If a third party does so, such entitlements and benefits will be subject to whatever terms are provided by such third parties. We are not responsible or liable for any third-party ONFT/NFT Marketplace, any Direct Sales, or any third-party entitlements or benefits. You covenant not to sue Omniverse Labs based on activities that may occur on such ONFT/NFT Marketplaces, any Direct Sales (except Direct Sales for which Omniverse Labs is the seller or purchase), due to third-party benefits or entitlements.</p>

                <h3>3. Ownership of a GREG.</h3>
                <p>(a) When Purchaser acquires a GREG, Purchaser owns all personal property rights to that GREG (e.g., the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that GREG); however, such rights expressly do not include the ownership of the intellectual property rights in the Art. Such rights are licensed pursuant to Section 4 below and those terms govern. In accordance with the foregoing, at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any GREG.
                (b) Purchaser may freely sell or otherwise transfer its GREG consistent with Purchaser’s rights in such GREG  as defined in this Agreement (e.g., posting a sales listing on an ONFT/NFT Marketplace, by Direct Sale, or otherwise) (a “Permitted Transfer”), so long as the Transferee (as defined below) is not (i) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; or (ii) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties (a “Prohibited Transferee”). Purchaser represents and warrants that it is not and will not transfer a GREG to a Prohibited Transferee.</p>

                <h3>4. License</h3>
                <p>(a) Non-Commercial License to the Art. 
                Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Omniverse Labs hereby grants to you, for so long as you own a GREG (as recorded on the relevant blockchain), a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, revocable license, with no right to sublicense, to use, copy, and display the Art linked to your purchased GREG solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use (e.g., home display, display in a virtual gallery, or as a social media avatar), including to create a reasonable number of back-up copies and a physical print out, each to be retained only for so long as you own the associated GREG; and (ii) as part of a Omniverse Labs’ or third party’s website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your GREG, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies that only the actual owner can display the Art, and the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the GREG leaves the website/application.
                (b) Full Commercial License to the Art. In addition, subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Omniverse Labs hereby grants to you, for so long as you own a GREG (as recorded on the relevant blockchain), an exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, revocable license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, distribute, create derivative works of (subject to the below), and display the Art linked to your purchased GREG for Commercial Purposes. “Commercial Purposes” means the use of the Art for all lawful commercial purposes, whether known now or created in the future. Such purposes may include merchandising, inclusion in physical or digital media, or display in “metaverses” or other interactive digital environments. You will have the right to retain all revenue that you generate through your exercise of your rights under this Section.
                (c) Derivative Works. Your rights also include the right to create derivative works of the Art to depict the character depicted in the GREG that you own in goods or media by, for example, showing their full body or back, or reformatting the relevant Art for a particular medium.  You may also modify the Art to create minor variations in the appearance or clothing, but such rights do not include the right to create characters substantially or confusingly similar to GREGs that you do not own.
                (d) Enforcement. You will have the non-exclusive right, but not the obligation, to bring an action to enforce any infringement of any rights you hold in the Art linked to your GREG as set forth in Sections 4(a)-(c).  We will have no obligation to support any such action.  We may also choose to bring such an action in our sole discretion.
                (e) Protection. You will have the right to procure registration or other intellectual property protection in the works that you create in exercising your license  to the Art linked to your GREG in a manner that complies with the terms of this Agreement, including that Omniverse Labs retains ownership of the underlying Art.  However, you must and hereby do agree to transfer any such registration or other protection in connection with a Permitted Transfer of your GREG, unless you expressly agree otherwise in writing with the Transferee.
                (f) Name and Trademarks. As provided in Section 5(c), no trademark rights are granted to you by Omniverse Labs. However, you may acquire trademark rights yourself in your GREG (which, for avoidance of doubt, do not include rights to the “GREG” trademark) through the exercise of your license rights above in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law. Any trademark rights that you acquire, and the associated goodwill, will transfer in connection with a Permitted Transfer of your GREG unless you expressly agree otherwise in writing with the Transferee.
                (g) Transfer. The licenses in Section 4 are non-transferrable, except that they will automatically transfer in connection with a Permitted Transfer of your GREG.</p>

                <h3>5. Reservation of Rights.</h3>
                <p>(a) General. All rights in and to the Art not expressly provided for in this Agreement are hereby reserved by Omniverse Labs. The Art is licensed, not sold. Omniverse Labs owns and will retain all title, interest, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Art.
                (b) Limitations. Without limitation of Section 5(a) above, the license in Section 4(b) does not include: (i) the right to use the Art to create non-fungible tokens or other digital items accounted for on a distributed ledger;  (ii) the right to create derivative works of the Art, except as expressly provided herein; or (iii) the right to use the GREG or the Art to create, or as the basis of, any token or digital items accounted for or recorded on a distributed ledger, including, but not limited to, any token or digital items accounted for or recorded on a distributed ledger that represent (A) an ownership interest in the GREG, or (B) any right that is convertible for, exchangeable into, or exercisable for, any right, title or interest in or to the GREG or the Art.
                (c) No Rights to Trademarks. For avoidance of doubt, the licenses in Section 4 do not include the right to use any Omniverse Labs’ trademarks (e.g., GREG, Omni X and Omniverse Labs). No trademark or other rights based on designation of source or origin are licensed to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent you acquire any rights to any Omniverse Labs’ trademarks, in consideration for the licenses granted pursuant to Section 4(b), you hereby assign to Omniverse Labs all rights, title, and interest in and to such trademarks, together with all associated goodwill.
                (d) Disputes Among Owners.  Omniverse Labs has no obligation to support the resolution of or to resolve any dispute that may arise between or among GREG owners.
                (e) Clarifications.  Omniverse Labs reserves the right, but has no obligation, to  clarify the terms of this Agreement in relation to novel or unforeseen circumstances in its sole and exclusive discretion. If Omniverse Labs issues or provides any clarification about the terms of this Agreement, such clarification will be binding on the Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby waives any right that Purchaser may have to dispute it in any manner.</p>

                <h3>6. Transfers.</h3>
                <p>You hereby agree that all subsequent transactions involving your GREG are subject to the following terms: (a) the GREG transferee (the “Transferee”) shall, by purchasing, accepting, accessing or otherwise using the GREG or Art, be deemed to accept all of the terms of this Agreement as a “Purchaser” hereof; (b) the GREG transferor (the “Transferor”) shall provide notice to the Transferee of this Agreement, including a link or other method by which the terms of this Agreement can be accessed by the Transferee. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that all subsequent transactions involving your GREG will be effected on the blockchain network governing the GREG, and Purchaser will be required to make or receive payments exclusively through Purchaser’s cryptocurrency wallet; (c) the Transferor shall pay or cause to be paid to Omniverse Labs amount equal to 5% of the total purchase price for the GREG in connection with the transaction between the Transferor and the Transferee (the “Royalty Payment”), which Royalty Payment shall be paid on the same terms and at the same time as the Transferor is paid by the Transferee. You acknowledge and agree that the Royalty Payment; and (d) each such subsequent transaction shall be effected on the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains. For the avoidance of doubt, you (as Transferor) and all subsequent Transferees (to the extent they are Transferors) are responsible for paying each Royalty Payment to the extent such Royalty Payment is not automatically paid as a result of the operation of the smart contract related to the GREG.</p>

                <h3>7. Omniverse Labs’ Rights and Obligations to the Art. </h3>
                <p>Omniverse Labs is not responsible for the ultimate rendering of the Art.</p>

                <h3>8. Purchaser’s Representations and Warranties.</h3>
                <p> Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser (a) is the age of majority in Purchaser’s place of residence (which is typically 18 years of age) and has the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement; (b) that Purchaser will use and interact with the GREG and Art only for lawful purposes and in accordance with this Agreement; and (c) will not use the GREG or Art to violate any law, regulation or ordinance or any right of Omniverse Labs, its licensors, or any third party, including without limitation, any right of privacy, publicity, copyright, trademark, or patent. Purchaser further represents and warrants that Purchaser will comply with all applicable law in the exercise of its rights and obligations under this Agreement.</p>

                <h3>9. Warranty Disclaimers.</h3>
                <p>EACH GREG IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, Omniverse Labs EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. Omniverse Labs MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT ANY GREG WILL MEET PURCHASER’S REQUIREMENTS, BE CONTINUALLY DISPLAYED, OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. Omniverse Labs MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY GREG.
                Omniverse Labs WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR ANY LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY GREG AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR, ANY USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY GREG, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED WALLET ADDRESSES; (II) THE BEHAVIOR OR OUTPUT OF ANY SOFTWARE, NODE SERVER ERROR OR FAILURE, OR DATA LOSS OR CORRUPTION; (III) ANY FEATURES, DEVELOPMENT, ERRORS, OR OTHER ISSUES WITH BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS; (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY GREG; OR (V) ANY THIRD PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK.
                EACH GREG IS AN INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSET THAT EXISTS ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED ON THE Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains, WHICH Omniverse Labs DOES NOT CONTROL. Omniverse Labs DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT Omniverse Labs CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY GREG. PURCHASER BEARS FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, Omniverse Labs MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS.
                SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

                <h3>10. Assumption of Risk.</h3>
                <p> Purchaser accepts and acknowledges all risks associated with the following:
                (a) The disclaimers in Section 9 above;
                (b) Purchaser is solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to Purchaser’s purchase, sale, or transfer of rights in each GREG. Omniverse Labs is not responsible for determining or paying the taxes that apply to such transactions.
                (c) Each GREG is a digital asset recorded and transferable on the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains. Any transfer of digital assets occurs through automated processes within the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains, possibly with support from an ONFT/NFT Marketplace or other third-party services, all of which are not controlled in any capacity by Omniverse Labs. Transactions relating to GREGs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions relating to the GREGs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that Purchaser initiated the transaction.
                (d) There are risks associated with using an Internet based digital asset, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software, and Internet connection and service issues, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. Omniverse Labs will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience when effecting transactions relating to any GREG, however caused.
                (e) Transactions involving GREGs may rely on third-party or decentralized platforms or systems. We do not maintain, control, or assume any obligations with respect to such platforms or systems.  Omniverse Labs does not store your password, passkey, private key or other credentials needed to access the GREGs, and will not be able to recover such items if you should lose them. Purchaser should keep a copy of Purchaser’s password, passkey or private key in a secure location.</p>

                <h3>11. Links to Third-Party Websites or Resources.</h3>
                <p>Use and interaction of the GREG and the Art may allow Purchaser to access third-party websites or other resources. To the extent that Omniverse Labs provides links or access to such sites and/or resources, it does so only as a convenience and is not responsible for the content, products, or services on or available from those resources or through any links displayed on such websites. Purchaser acknowledges sole responsibility for, and assumes all risk arising from, Purchaser’s use of any third-party sites or resources. Under no circumstances shall Purchaser’s inability to view or use Art on a third-party website serve as grounds for a claim against Omniverse Labs.</p>

                <h3>12. Termination of License to the Art.</h3>
                <p> Purchaser’s licenses to the Art shall automatically terminate and all rights shall revert to Omniverse Labs if at any time: (a) Purchaser breaches any portion of this Agreement, including any failure to pay any Royalty Payment, (b) Purchaser engages in any unlawful activity related to the GREG (including transferring the GREG to a Prohibited Transferee), or (c) if Omniverse Labs has a reasonable basis for believing that you have engaged in a subsequent transaction with respect to a GREG that is not recorded on, effected by, or otherwise conducted using the Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Binance/Optimism/Avalanche/Fantom blockchains, or is otherwise conducted in a manner reasonably likely to cause the Royalty Payment to not be timely paid. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of Purchaser’s licenses to the Art, Omniverse Labs may disable Purchaser’s access to the Art and Purchaser shall delete, remove, or otherwise destroy any back up or other digital or physical copy of the Art. Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of the license in this Agreement, the following Sections will survive: 3, 5 through 17.</p>

                <h3>13. Indemnity.</h3>
                <p>Purchaser shall defend, indemnify, and hold Omniverse Labs, its licensors, affiliates, representatives, and service providers, and each of them, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, investigations, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, expenses and other similar results or occurrences (including attorneys’ fees) that directly or indirectly arise from or are related to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding or other similar occurrence, process or activity, that is initiated, made, brought or financed by a third party (including any person who accesses or transacts using any GREG whether or not such person personally purchased a GREG) against the Indemnified Parties, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of or in connection with (a) your access to or use of the ONFT/NFT Marketplace or any third-party services or products, (b) your breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, (c) your exercise of the licenses in Section 4, or (d) your actual or alleged violation of applicable law.</p>

                <h3>14. Limitation of Liability.</h3>
                <p>(a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO INDEMNIFIED PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR INTERACT WITH ANY GREG OR ACCESS THE ART, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT Omniverse Labs OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
                (b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ALL INDEMNIFIED PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR INTERACT WITH THE GREGS OR ACCESS THE ART, OR ANY OF THE RIGHTS AND LICENSES GRANTED HEREIN, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).
                (c) BY PURCHASING OR OWNING A GREG, PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Omniverse Labs AND PURCHASER.</p>

                <h3>15. Governing Law and Forum Choice.</h3>
                <p>This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 16 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) will be the state and federal courts located in the State and City of New York, and you and Omniverse Labs each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>

                <h3>16. Dispute Resolution.</h3>
                <p>(a) Informal Dispute Resolution.  Without limitation of Omniverse Labs’ rights in Section 12, the Parties must first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or the use of the GREG (collectively, “Disputes”) informally. Accordingly, neither Party may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing.  As part of this informal resolution process, Purchaser must deliver a written notice of any Dispute via first-class mail to Omniverse Labs at: Omniverse Labs, 1450 S Dixie Hwy Ste 105 1075, Coral Gables, FL 33146.
                (b) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.  The Parties agree that any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. The Parties agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, and that each Party is waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
                (c) Exceptions.  As limited exception to Section 16(b) above: (i) the Parties may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) each Party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
                (d) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at  or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A Party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other Party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at .
                Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, with provision to be made for remote appearances to the maximum extent permitted by the AAA rules, unless we both agree to a different location. The Parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
                (e) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and Omniverse Labs won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees Omniverse Labs is responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute is frivolous. If Omniverse Labs prevails in arbitration, Omniverse Labs will pay all of its attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
                (f) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 16(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or Omniverse Labs prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The Parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
                (g) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND Omniverse Labs AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if a Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
